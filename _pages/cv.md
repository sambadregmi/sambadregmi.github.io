Education
======
* <b>B.E. in Mechanical Engineering, Visvesvaraya Technological University, India </b>
  * Date: June, 2016 (Percentage: 85%)
* <b>Ph.D in Mechanical Engineering, Missouri University of Science and Technology, Rolla-MO, USA </b>
  * Date: May, 2022 (GPA: 3.93)
  * Doctoral Thesis Title: “Development of an Interactive Robot for Overground Physical Human-Robot Interaction”
  * Project: “Human Arm Impedance Modulation during Overground Physical Interactions”(funded by National Science Foundation)
  * Advisor: [Dr. Yun Seong Song](https://sites.mst.edu/yunseongsong/)

Employment
======
* **Senior Mechatronics Engineer**, ASML, Wilton-CT (May 2022 - Present)
 Working with system architects in a multi-discipline project team to develop concepts, perform engineering analysis, and build and test mechatronics prototypes.
  * Create budgets, set requirements and facilitate development of the module.
  * Act as a technical leader and contribute to breakdown of complex technical problems, analyze the problems from different angles and find multiple solutions to choose from.
  * Understand team goal, provide deliverable on time and take responsibility for the decisions.
  * Define, plan and priorities tasks and follow-up on results.
  * Communicate clear to technical team (and broad audience), about directions and expectations and follow up and feedback on results.
* **Graduate Research Assistant**, Missouri University of Science and Technology, Rolla-MO (August 2017 - April 2022)
  * Designed and developed robotic manipulator for physical human robot interaction experiments; Selected required hardware and software for the robot; and, currently trying to implement various force, position, and velocity control strategies on the robot
  * Developed a "dynamics" simulator of a robotic manipulator using Lagrangian method; estimated the friction/damping of rotational joints, and verified its accuracy using the effective inertia estimate; developed a method to estimate the output impedance of a manipulator using the robotic simulator
  * Selected a data acquisition and analysis technique for experiments involving our robot
  * Designed and conducted a human-robot interaction experiment, including acquiring an IRB approval, recruiting and interacting with the participants, preparing and maintaining the experiment setup, and collecting and analyzing the data.
  * Currently, preparing the manuscripts in order to report outcomes of the experiments.
* **Engineering Intern (Mechatronics)**, ASML, Wilton-CT (September 2021 - December 2021)
  * Worked on sub-systems involving robotics, mechatronics, and precision mechanics, which involved understanding the functional requirements and deriving specifications
