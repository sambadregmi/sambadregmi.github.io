Employment
======
* **Graduate Research Assistant**, Missouri University of Science and Technology, Rolla-MO (August 2017 - Present)
  * Designed and developed robotic manipulator for physical human robot interaction experiments; Selected required hardware and software for the robot; and, currently trying to implement various force, position, and velocity control strategies on the robot
  * Developed a "dynamics" simulator of a robotic manipulator using Lagrangian method; estimated the friction/damping of rotational joints, and verified its accuracy using the effective inertia estimate; developed a method to estimate the output impedance of a manipulator using the robotic simulator
  * Currently selecting a data acquisition and analysis technique for experiments involving our robot
  * Currently, designing and conducting a human-robot interaction experiment, including acquiring an IRB approval, recruiting and interacting with the participants, preparing and maintaining the experiment setup, collecting and analyzing the data, and reporting results
* **Engineering Intern, Mechatronics**, ASML, Wilton-CT (August 2021 - Present)
  * Working on sub-systems involving robotics, mechatronics, and precision mechanics, which involves understanding the functional requirements and deriving specifications.
  * Working with system architects in a multidiscipline project team to develop concepts, perform engineering analysis, and build and test prototypes.
* **Quality Assurance and Maintenance Engineer**, Nepal Health Research Council, Nepal (June 2016 - June 2017)
  * Involved in solving various issues related to the equipment for ECG and Sprirometry tests that were used in project "Prevalence of Chronic Diseases in Nepal"}
  * Coordinated with health workers and patients for smooth and effortless use of the devices
