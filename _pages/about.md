Hi! I am Sambad, a PhD Candidate in [Mechanical Engineering](https://mae.mst.edu/) at the [Missouri University of Science and Technology, Rolla](https://www.mst.edu/). I will be graduating in May, 2022. After building a robot (with very unique requirements) that is capable of doing overground physical human robot interaction (pHRI) experiments in laboratory setting, our group proceeded with the human-robot interaction overground experiments. While doing so, I designed and conducted the human-robot interaction experiments, which included responsibilities such as acquiring an IRB approval, recruiting and interacting with the participants, preparing and maintaining the experiment setup, conducting the experiment, and collecting and analyzing the data. 

Currently, I am working on manuscripts to report the results obtained from the experiments. On the other hand, I am also working as a Co-op (Mechatronics) at ASML, Wilton where I am involved with the research and development team in analyzing the dynamics of the mechatronics subsystem.

# Research Interests

My research interests mainly lie within the field of **mechatronics** with an emphasis on: 
1. Mechatronics, robotics, and controls
2. Data acquisition and analysis of human experiments
3. Rehabilitation robotics
4. Kinematics and dynamics of robotic manipulators as well as human arms
5. Human-human and human-robot interaction
6. Human neuromechancis
