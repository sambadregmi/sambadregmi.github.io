Hi! I am Sambad. I graduated with a Ph.D. in [Mechanical Engineering](https://mae.mst.edu/) from the [Missouri University of Science and Technology, Rolla ](https://www.mst.edu/)(formerly, University of Missouri -- Rolla) in April, 2022. After building a robot (with very unique requirements) that is capable of performing overground physical human-robot interaction (pHRI) experiments in laboratory setting, our group proceeded with the overground physical human-robot interaction experiments. While doing so, I designed and conducted the experiments, which included responsibilities such as acquiring an IRB approval, recruiting and interacting with the participants, preparing and maintaining the experiment setup, conducting the experiment, and collecting and analyzing the data. On the other hand, I also worked as a Co-op (Mechatronics) at ASML-Wilton, where I worked with the research and development team for analyzing the dynamics of the mechatronics sub-systems.

Currently, I am working as a senior mechatronics engineer at ASML, Wilton, CT. %on preparing manuscripts to report the results obtained from the pionering overground pHRI experiments.

# Research Interests

My research interests mainly lie within the field of **mechatronics** with an emphasis on: 
1. Mechatronics, robotics, and controls
2. Data acquisition
3. Rehabilitation robotics
4. Kinematics and dynamics of robotic manipulators as well as human arms
5. Human-human and human-robot interaction
6. Human neuromechanics
