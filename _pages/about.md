Hi! I am Sambad. I graduated with a Ph.D. in [Mechanical Engineering](https://mae.mst.edu/) from the [Missouri University of Science and Technology, Rolla ](https://www.mst.edu/)(formerly, University of Missouri -- Rolla) in May, 2022. During my PhD, I developed an Interactive Robot for Overground Physical Human-Robot Interaction (pHRI), and designed and conducted several human-robot experiments, which involved acquiring an IRB approval, recruiting and interacting with the participants, preparing and maintaining the experiment setup, conducting the experiment, and collecting and analyzing the data.

Currently, I work as a senior mechatronics engineer at ASML, Wilton, CT. In the development and engineering team, my role typically involves analyzing the dynamic performance and stability of the mechatronics sub-systems of EUV photolithography machines.

# Research Interests

My research interests mainly lie within the field of **mechatronics** with an emphasis on: 
1. Mechatronics, robotics, and controls
2. Data acquisition
3. Rehabilitation robotics
4. Kinematics and dynamics of robotic manipulators as well as human arms
5. Human-human and human-robot interaction
6. Human neuromechanics
