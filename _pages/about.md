Hi! I am Sambad, a PhD Candidate in [Mechanical Engineering](https://mae.mst.edu/) at the [Missouri University of Science and Technology, Rolla](https://www.mst.edu/). I will be graduating in May, 2022. After building a robot (with very unique requirements) that is capable of doing overground physical human robot interaction (pHRI) experiments in laboratory setting, I am currently working on to proceed with human-robot interaction experiments. My current work includes designing and conducting human-robot interaction experiments, including acquiring an IRB approval, recruiting and interacting with the participants, preparing and maintaining the experiment setup, collecting and analyzing the data, and reporting results.

# Research Interests

My research interests mainly lie within the field of **mechatronics** with an emphasis on: 
1. Robotics and controls
2. Data acquisition and analysis of human experiments
3. Rehabilitation robotics
4. Kinematics and dynamics of robotic manipulators as well as human arms
5. Human-human and human-robot interaction
6. Human neuromechancis
