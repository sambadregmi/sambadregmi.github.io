We, humans, are able to accomplish overground physical interaction tasks adeptly. These interaction tasks do not necessarily require visual and verbal communication, which suggests that the interacting partners might exchange the kinematic information to communicate. To understand the process of motor intent exchange, we present an overground robot-guided walking experiment designed and conducted to capture human biomechanic response during the interaction. We tested the hypothesis that the nervous system lowers the arm stiffness to sensitively exchange forces and motions. The outcome of the experiment agrees with our hypotheses.
