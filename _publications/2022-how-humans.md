Humans can physically interact with other humans adeptly. Some overground interaction tasks, such as guiding a partner across a room, occur without visual and verbal communication, which suggests that the information exchanges occur through sensing movements and forces. To understand the process of motor communication during overground physical interaction, we hypothesized that humans modulate the mechanical properties of their arms for increased awareness and sensitivity to ongoing interaction. For this, we used an overground interactive robot to guide a human partner across one of three randomly chosen paths while occasionally providing force perturbations to measure the arm stiffness. We observed that the arm stiffness was lower at instants when the robotâ€™s upcoming trajectory was unknown compared to instants when it was predicable - the first evidence of arm stiffness modulation for better motor communication during overground physical interaction.
