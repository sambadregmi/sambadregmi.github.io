**Background:** Light Touch (LT) has been known to improve standing balance without 
mechanical support by providing sensory information about the movement of the body. 
However, harnessing the benefit of LT for practical balance aid remains a challenge.
Research question: Can a Virtual Cane (VC) show the benefit of a physical cane by providing 
sensory information inspired by LT? <br />
**Methods:** The VC is developed with a distance sensor and vibration actuators to provide cane 
tip-to-ground distance information to the user. 10 healthy young participants underwent a 
standing balance experiment with tandem stance and eyes closed, using VC with No Feedback 
(NF), VC with feedback, and with physical cane (PC). Center-of-Pressure (CoP) metrics as well 
as Sway-density metrics were analyzed to study the effect of these conditions on standing 
balance. <br />
**Results:** CoP metrics in VC were significantly improved compared to baseline (NF) and
approaching the benefit of a full physical cane (PC). Sway-density metrics showed no difference 
between the conditions. <br />
**Significance:** This shows that simple, binary feedback from VC on the position of the body and 
cane was sufficient to positively affect standing balance without significantly altering the 
biomechanical strategy of standing balance. This is also a demonstration of an assistive device 
with a complete absence of mechanical support that can provide substantial benefit to balance.
