The paper presents a new design method that is tailored for designing a physical interactive robotic arm for overground physical interaction. Designing such robotic arms present various unique requirements that differ from existing robotic arms, which are used for general manipulation, such as being able to generate required forces at every point inside the workspace and/or having low intrinsic mechanical impedance. Our design method identifies these requirements and categorizes them into kinematic and dynamic characteristics of the robot and then ensures that these unique considerations are satisfied in the early design phase. The robot’s capability for use in such tasks is analyzed using mathematical simulations of the designed robot, and discussion of its dynamic characteristics is presented. With our proposed method, the robot arm is ensured to perform various overground interactive tasks with a human.
